        Great news, you did everything right by booking ahead of time. Your
        options are a) Move all that you paid to the new date, travel insurance
        and 100% of funds transfer to the new date. b) If you want cash back,
        you can get it all cash back with the exception of the $75/adult
        insurance and have the option to rebook later if you like. c) Want to
        keep your Nov 2020 trip to Cancun regardless of our wedding? Talk to V.

        welcome drinks, and easy coordination for the wedding coordinator.

        The resort is all inclusive. Meaning food, 24/7 room service, premium
        beverages, and activites all included. The resort is located at one of
        the most gorgeous areas in Cancun on a peninsula. Also family friendly.
        Let us know if you're interested in sharing a room.

        This can seem confusing at first. It actually saves the guests money
        when families are sharing rooms. There are group benefits to sharing
        rooms: free transportation to/from airport, locked in rate, welcome
        drinks, and easy coordination for the wedding coordinator especially in
        emergency situation such as COVID-19.
        <em>
          If you do not book on the room block, you may not be able to attend
          the wedding or spend time with the wedding party.

        Book as soon as you feel comfortable with any airline of your choice.
        Fly into Cancun airport (CUN). For convenience and affordability, we
        previously recommended Southwest airlines. As of June 2020 with COVID-19
        there are only direct flights from: Denver and Houston. Airlines are
        slowly releasing more fligths.

        A hotel shuttle is included with your booking. When you book your room,
        Jessica will ask for your arrival time and will coordinate a shuttle to
        take you to the resort.
