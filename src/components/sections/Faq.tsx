        The resort is all inclusive. Meaning food, 24/7 room service, premium
        beverages, and activites all included. The resort is located at one of
        the most gorgeous areas in Cancun on a peninsula. Also family friendly.
        Let us know if you're interested in sharing a room.

        This can seem confusing at first. It actually saves the guests money
        when families are sharing rooms. There are group benefits to sharing
        rooms: free transportation to/from airport, locked in rate, welcome
        drinks, and easy coordination for the wedding coordinator especially in
        emergency situation such as COVID-19.{' '}

          If you do not book on the room block, you may not be able to attend
          the wedding or spend time with the wedding party.

        Book as soon as you feel comfortable with any airline of your choice.
        Fly into Cancun airport (CUN). For convenience and affordability, we
        previously recommended Southwest airlines.

        take you to the resort.

        No! Having you all at the wedding with us to celebrate safely was so

        will be. PS Please get your dang COVID shot.
