        We're still shooting for November, but if the virus hasn't settled down
        by then, we're all in bigger trouble than a cancelled wedding.
        Coronavirus is a big deal, so we understand if you hold off on booking
        travel. However, we would like you to mark your calendars. We recommend
        getting a fully refundable flight and separately purchashing travel
        insurance through our travel agent, Jessica.

        No. Really please donâ€™t. This will severely complicate things for our
        wedding. The resorts for these type of weddings depend on the guests
        staying at the resort. For rare situations where you cannot stay the 3
        nights or at the resort but want to attend the wedding, please contact
        John or Victoria.

        This can seem confusing at first. It actually saves the guests money
        when families are sharing rooms. If you are interested in sharing a room
        with another guest, please let us know and we can pair you with someone.
        All rates are locked in on the room block.{' '}
        <em>
          If you do not book on the room block, you may not be able to attend
          the wedding or spend time with the wedding party.

        Book as soon as you feel comfortable with any airline of your choice.
        Fly into Cancun airport (CUN). For convenience and affordability, we
        previously recommended Southwest airlines. As of June 2020 with COVID-19
        there are only direct flights from: Denver and Houston. Airlines are
        slowly releasing more fligths.

        A hotel shuttle is included with your booking. When you book your room,
        Jessica will ask for your arrival time and will coordinate a shuttle to
        take you to the resort.

        The wedding couple will be arriving Tuesday, 11/17. The wedding party
        will arrive Wednesday, 11/18. You can stay as long as you like, but keep
        in mind all guests are required to a minimum of three nights. We
        recommend coming at least the day before 11/19, staying for the weekend,
        and checking out 11/22. There will be a planned included group activity
        the day after the wedding, Saturday 11/21.
