        If the virus is impacting the world by this November to a point where
        none of us can travel to Mexico, this is scary and for reasons that go
        well beyond our wedding. We recognize budgeting and fear of travel are
        huge factors in attending the wedding and we are hoping to work
        something out to make it easier for everyone to come once itâ€™s safe. We
        will have more information as soon as we can. For now, it is totally
        understandable that you donâ€™t follow normal booking procedure, just mark
        your calendars.

        No. Really please donâ€™t this will severely complicate things for our
        wedding. The resorts for these type of weddings depend on the guests

        We were personally very confused about also. It actually saves the
        guests money and makes all guests rates locked in so that guests don't
        get competive over a better deal and feel cheated. It is crucial you
        book on the room block otherwise you can get escorted out of the wedding
        activities. Sorry I don't have more info I am working on a clearer
        explanantion.

        The wedding party will arrive Wednesday, 11/18. You can stay as long as
        you like, but keep in mind all guests are required to a minimum of three
        nights. We recommend coming at least the day before 11/19, staying for
        the weekend, and checking out 11/22. There will be a planned included
        group activity the day after the wedding, Saturday 11/21.

        This is totally up to you. The wedding guests will be spread out through
        the resort and all rooms have access to all amenities with the exception
        of the adults only Turquoise area - is a small rooftop pool area. If
        youâ€™re into luxury and donâ€™t have kids feel welcome to stay at the
        Turquoise of course. We - the wedding couple - will likely stay there,
        but donâ€™t feel bad if you donâ€™t.

        Yes, anyone that you love we love and is welcome to come! One of the

        count.
