          The wedding party will arrive Wednesday, 11/18. You can stay as long
          as you like, but keep in mind all guests are required to a minimum of
          three nights. We recommend coming at least the day before 11/19,
          staying for the weekend, and checking out 11/22. There will be a
          planned included group activity the day after the wedding, Saturday
          11/21. Plan to stay at least 3 nights in the window November 18th -
          22nd

          <strong>What room should I get?</strong>
          <br />
          This is totally up to you. The wedding guests will be spread out
          through the resort and all rooms have access to all amenities with the
          exception of the adults only Turquoise area - is a small rooftop pool
          area. If you’re into luxury and don’t have kids feel welcome to stay
          at the Turquoise of course. We - the wedding couple - will likely stay
          there, but don’t feel bad if you don’t.

          <strong>Can I invite a plus 1?</strong>
          <br />
          Yes, anyone that you love we love and is welcome to come! One of the
          benefits of a destination wedding is we don’t have to sweat about head
          count.
