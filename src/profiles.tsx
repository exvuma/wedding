          Eric and I have been brothers since the day we met. We‚Äôve maintained a
          close relationship through the years, mostly through iMessage because
          when I‚Äôm on a plane, that‚Äôs the only thing available on the free WiFi,
          and he‚Äôs the only person that regularly responds.

          When I was 17, Eric -- only a teenager himself -- moved to Virginia to
          be with a lady from the internet (üëãJFaw2!). Eric gave me his electric
          guitar and sweet ass van. Even with my brother gone, the things he
          passed on continued to influence my personality and way of thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eric was the drum major when we were in marching band together and the
          singer for our high school rock band, Books for the Blind (Nobody
          Special (Filthy Dogs)). We played together in a heavier rock band
          called Allerion. He‚Äôs the reason why I got into music and still play
          guitar today. Thanks for giving me a life-long hobby, brother.

          My best friend. We met at UCLA during sorority rush - though the
          sorority didn‚Äôt work out for me üòê- I knew I wanted to be Laura‚Äôs
          sister for life. So I stalked Laura‚Äôs first waitressing job at O‚Äôharas
          where we ended up working together. Shortly after, we became best
          friends / roommates / soulmates in Westwood and again in Santa Monica.
          Laura has visited John and in Austin more than anyone else. Laura was
          also the very first of the wedding party to meet our first adopted
          child - Cersei. No one can make us laugh or love like Laura.

          Amy is my oldest sister and when I was born I became her real life
          baby doll. Though having an extreme overprotective older sister your
          whole life may not have seemed that much fun for me, Amy was a cool
          surrogate mom (...well aside from holding my hand in parking lots
          until 16 wasn‚Äôt that cool). From constant hip-riding, diaper changes,
          and prom night party chaperoning our love has never wavered. Amy says
          she couldn‚Äôt be prouder of me, her little ‚Äòpuker‚Äô, she claims to have
          ‚Äòraised‚Äô for finding such a man like John.

          There is no one with quite as many funny stories as Guliette. She‚Äôs my
          slightly older middle sister. Best friends from the days of Barbie
          Dolls, and putting fire ant piles down each others pants, we know how
          to keep each other laughing, and right out of the midst of trouble.
          The saying two peas in a pod used to make us bashful, but we now find
          it endearing. The love we have for one another will continue to thrive
          far beyond the childhood we once shared in the backwoods of rural
          Texas, and in the buzzing streets of Silicon Valley.

          At UCLA Sofia and I became friends through a love of venturing from

          relationship based on partying quickly evolved as we recognized a
          shared drive for fitness and career goals. Sofia made me family by
          introducing me to Sofia‚Äôs phenomenal sister, Christina, where we were
          all three roommates.
