          Eric and I have been brothers since the day we met. Weâ€™ve maintained a
          close relationship through the years, mostly through iMessage because
          when Iâ€™m on a plane, thatâ€™s the only thing available on the free WiFi,
          and heâ€™s the only person that regularly responds.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I was 17, Eric -- only a teenager himself -- moved to Virginia to
          be with a lady from the internet (ðŸ‘‹JFaw2!). Eric gave me his electric
          guitar and sweet ass van. Even with my brother gone, the things he
          passed on continued to influence my personality and way of thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eric was the drum major when we were in marching band together and the
          singer for our high school rock band, Books for the Blind (Nobody
          Special (Filthy Dogs)). We played together in a heavier rock band
          called Allerion. Heâ€™s the reason why I got into music and still play
          guitar today. Thanks for giving me a life-long hobby, brother.
