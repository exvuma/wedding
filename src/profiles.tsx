          Eric and I have been brothers since the day we met. We‚Äôve maintained a
          close relationship through the years, mostly through iMessage because
          when I‚Äôm on a plane, that‚Äôs the only thing available on the free WiFi,
          and he‚Äôs the only person that regularly responds.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I was 17, Eric -- only a teenager himself -- moved to Virginia to
          be with a lady from the internet (üëãJFaw2!). Eric gave me his electric
          guitar and sweet ass van. Even with my brother gone, the things he
          passed on continued to influence my personality and way of thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eric was the drum major when we were in marching band together and the
          singer for our high school rock band, Books for the Blind (Nobody
          Special (Filthy Dogs)). We played together in a heavier rock band
          called Allerion. He‚Äôs the reason why I got into music and still play
          guitar today. Thanks for giving me a life-long hobby, brother.

V stalked Laura‚Äôs first waitressing job at O‚Äôharas where they ended up working together. Shortly after, they became best friends /  roommates / soulmates in Westwood and again in Santa Monica. Laura gives unconditional love even after trauma, vast amounts of lost shoes, and beautifully ruined borrowed outfits. Laura has visited John and V in Austin more than anyone else. Laura was also the very first of the wedding party to meet our first adopted child - Cersei. No one can make us laugh or love like Laura.</p>

From constant hip-riding, diaper changes, and prom night party chaperoning their love has never wavered. Amy couldn‚Äôt be prouder of the little ‚Äòpuker‚Äô she ‚Äòraised.‚Äô Bragging everywhere she goes about her little masterpiece who has been so studious, successful, self-aware, and hardworking has felt almost surreal. Although on the outside she might seem to be taking all credit, she knows that the thing she is most proud is that Victoria really started as this ‚Äòlittle person‚Äô that did it all on her own and finding a match like John.

        <p>There is no one with quite as many funny stories as Guliette. The slightly older middle sister to little miss Pookieness22. Best friends from the days of Barbie Dolls, and putting fire ant piles down each others pants. They know how to keep each other laughing, and right out of the midst of trouble. The saying two peas in a pod used to make us bashful, but we now find it endearing. The love we have for one another will continue to thrive far beyond the childhood we once shared in the backwoods of rural Texas, and in the buzzing streets of Silicon Valley.</p>
