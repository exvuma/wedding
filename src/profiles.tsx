          Eric and I have been brothers since the day we met. We‚Äôve maintained a
          close relationship through the years, mostly through iMessage because
          when I‚Äôm on a plane, that‚Äôs the only thing available on the free WiFi,
          and he‚Äôs the only person that regularly responds.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I was 17, Eric -- only a teenager himself -- moved to Virginia to
          be with a lady from the internet (üëãJFaw2!). Eric gave me his electric
          guitar and sweet ass van. Even with my brother gone, the things he
          passed on continued to influence my personality and way of thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eric was the drum major when we were in marching band together and the
          singer for our high school rock band, Books for the Blind (Nobody
          Special (Filthy Dogs)). We played together in a heavier rock band
          called Allerion. He‚Äôs the reason why I got into music and still play
          guitar today. Thanks for giving me a life-long hobby, brother.

          My best friend. We met at UCLA during sorority rush - though the
          sorority didn‚Äôt work out for me üòê- I knew I wanted to be Laura‚Äôs
          sister for life. So I stalked Laura‚Äôs first waitressing job at O‚Äôharas
          where we ended up working together. Shortly after, we became best
          friends / roommates / soulmates in Westwood and again in Santa Monica.
          Laura has visited John and in Austin more than anyone else. Laura was
          also the very first of the wedding party to meet our first adopted
          child - Cersei. No one can make us laugh or love like Laura.

          Amy is my oldest sister and when I was born I became her real life
          baby doll. Though having an extreme overprotective older sister your
          whole life may not have seemed that much fun for me, Amy was a cool
          surrogate mom (...well aside from holding my hand in parking lots
          until 16 wasn‚Äôt that cool). From constant hip-riding, diaper changes,
          and prom night party chaperoning our love has never wavered. Amy says
          she couldn‚Äôt be prouder of me, her little ‚Äòpuker‚Äô, she claims to have
          ‚Äòraised‚Äô for finding such a man like John.

          Jenna is my ride-or-die, she‚Äôs always been there for me for anything & everything! Our love for each other rapidly flourished into soul sisters. We met by matching on Bumble BFF on Tuesday, February, 7th, 2017 in Austin, Texas. For those of you unfamiliar with üêùBFF; it‚Äôs an app that matches BFF‚Äôs based on similarities and swipes!  
        </p>

        <p>
          My first in-person BFF date with Jenna was after a very long workweek; on Friday, February, 17th, 2017 at the Craft Pride beer bar on Rainey Street in Austin, Texas where we discovered our shared love for Craft Pride‚Äôs Girl Scout Cookies beer. üçª
        </p>

        <p>
          Jenna and I have laughed, loved, and cried together throughout the years. We‚Äôve seen one another go through the hard times and we‚Äôve always helped each other blossom into the lovely ladies we are today. From girls nights, game nights, buying homes in Austin, Lake days, and vacationing together, to rollerblading wipeouts and countless other cherished memories. One thing remains to only grow stronger in time; our irrevocable love for each other.
        </p>

        <p>
          My friendship with Jenna began before John and I started dating and I know without a doubt that she has my back no matter what; as do I for her, so of course, I‚Äôd want her to be by my side as my bridesmaid. ‚ù§Ô∏è

          At UCLA Sofia and I became friends through a love of venturing from
          Westwood into LA‚Äôs party capital - Hollywood. What started out as a
          relationship based on partying quickly evolved as we recognized a
          shared drive for fitness and career goals. Sofia made me family by
          introducing me to Sofia‚Äôs phenomenal sister, Christina, where we were
          all three roommates.

          Amanda we call Trillo because though her name is shared by many, she
          is a true one of a kind. I have known Amanda since middle school and
          we got to really be friends on the cheer squad at Pioneer High. We

          My best friend in Austin, even our pups Graham and Mister are BFFs. We
          love Tanya because she motivates John and me to get up on the
          microphone not just on karaoke nights but every night of the week. As
          my beauty artist, Tauns turned me as a dull burnette into a brilliant
          blonde. She shares a deep relationship with Jesus and is one
          beautifully hilarious being.

          Corey has always been there for us. Giving us advice about computer

          Stephen and I have been friends since we played in a band together for
          the 8th grade talent show. Even though we didn't win the competition,
          we continued to play in rock bands together thoughout highschool. We
          recorded multiple demos together and almost dropped out of college for
          a year to go on the road. Even though we wound up at different
          schools, we remained great friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          On April 20th, 2014, Stephen and I embarked on a road trip from
          Dallas, TX to Seattle Washington. With Bear the dog sleeping noisily
          in the back seat of Stephen's Tacoma, and all of his belongings in tow
          behind us, we set out on a path that would take us through Arches
          National Park in Utah and then straight to his new Apartment in
          Ballard in around 32 hours flat.
        </p>
        <p>
          We got there on a cold rainy Seattle morning around 6am and with no
          keys available to us, we were forced to sleep in the car until
          Stephen's new landlord showed up. Turns out, Seattle is beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've visited my friend once a year, every year since then and I have
          no plans of stopping now. I always appreciate your advice, your
          intellect, and craftmenship. You are a true mentor and friend.
